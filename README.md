# jupyterlab-gruvbox
Gruvbox theme and colorscheme for JupyterLab and Matplotlib.

It consists of:
- a single CSS `variables.css` that can be loaded with the Stylus browser extension for example
- a Matplotlib theme `gruvbox.mplstyle` that can be copied to `~/.config/matplotlib/stylelib/` and then loaded with Matplotlib

Spacing and arrangement inspired from [Atom Dark Theme for JupyterLab](https://github.com/BurglarBenson/Jupyter-Atom-Dark-Theme). I also customized the fonts, feel free to change the theme however you want.
