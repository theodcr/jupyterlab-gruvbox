# jupyterlab-gruvbox
Gruvbox colorscheme for JupyterLab

Work in progress, only CSS for now. You can load it with the Stylus browser extension for example.

Spacing and arrangement inspired from [Atom Dark Theme for JupyterLab](https://github.com/BurglarBenson/Jupyter-Atom-Dark-Theme). I also customized the fonts, feel free to change the theme however you want.
